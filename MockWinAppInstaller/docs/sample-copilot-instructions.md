# Copilot Instructions

This document outlines suggested prompts and workflows for using GitHub Copilot with this WPF project.

## Example Prompts
1. Generate a WPF command implementation for async file checksum calculation.
2. Suggest MVVM refactor for code-behind logic moving it into MainViewModel.
3. Create a service that simulates application update steps with progress reporting.

## Best Practices
- Keep prompts specific (mention method names or classes).
- Iterate: refine generated code with follow-up prompts.
- Review generated code for correctness and security.
